# Scene_Text_Recognition
An OCR (Optical Character Recognition) project that extracts and processes text from images and scanned documents with high accuracy, using image preprocessing, character recognition algorithms, and post-processing techniques for improved results.

# 📄 OCR Project – Optical Character Recognition

## 📝 Introduction
The **OCR Project** is an application that extracts and processes text from images and scanned documents with high accuracy.  
It leverages **image preprocessing techniques** and **machine learning models** to recognize characters, making it suitable for tasks such as document digitization, automated form processing, and data extraction from images.

The system is designed to be **flexible, fast, and accurate**, capable of handling multiple image formats and various text fonts.  
It also includes **post-processing steps** to improve recognition results, making it more reliable for real-world applications.

## 🎯 Features
- 📷 **Image Acquisition** – Supports loading images from local files or capturing directly from a camera.
- 🧹 **Image Preprocessing** – Applies techniques like grayscale conversion, thresholding, noise removal, and edge detection.
- 🔍 **Character Recognition** – Uses OCR algorithms to detect and convert characters into machine-readable text.
- ✏ **Post-processing** – Corrects recognition errors using dictionaries and NLP techniques.
- 📂 **Multi-format Support** – Works with common image formats such as PNG, JPG, and TIFF.
- ⚡ **High Accuracy** – Optimized for different fonts, handwriting, and printed documents.

## 🛠 How It Works
1. **Image Input** – User provides an image or scanned document.
2. **Preprocessing** – The image is cleaned, enhanced, and prepared for recognition.
3. **OCR Processing** – Characters are detected and converted into text.
4. **Post-processing** – Errors are corrected and final text is formatted.
5. **Output** – Extracted text is displayed or saved for later use.
